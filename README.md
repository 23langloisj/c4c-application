# Jake Langlois C4C Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application utilizing Node.js and Express.js for the backend API and React with TypeScript for the frontend. Basic CSS is used for styling. The backend API handles various routes, which are then displayed and managed on the frontend. API testing and debugging were conducted using Postman.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/23langloisj/c4c-application.git
    cd c4c-application.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## High-Level Overview

This application is a comprehensive full-stack project featuring:

- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.js, it handles API requests and defines various routes.
- **Frontend**: Developed using React and TypeScript, it interacts with the backend to display data dynamically. Basic CSS is used for styling.
- **API Testing**: Utilized Postman for efficient testing and debugging of API endpoints.

## Design Decisions

- **Technology Stack**: Chosen based on familiarity and efficiency:
  - **Express.js**: Preferred for its simplicity and robust feature set for building APIs.
  - **React**: Selected for its component-based architecture and ease of use in building dynamic UIs.
  - **TypeScript**: Used to leverage its type-checking capabilities, which from what I've heard from members is standard for club projects.
  
- **Routing and Endpoint Management**: Established clear and organized routes for the backend API to ensure seamless communication with the frontend.

## Reflection

### Learning and Improvements

- **Postman for API Testing**: Learned how to effectively use Postman, which significantly streamlined the debugging process and saved time.
- **TypeScript Best Practices**: As this was my first project using TypeScript, I learned various best practices that will be beneficial for future projects.

### Potential Enhancements

Given more time, I would have explored additional features and improvements, such as:
- Implementing advanced frontend features or animations.
- Tackling some of the bonus opportunities

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the primary challenges was synchronizing the frontend and backend, particularly ensuring seamless data flow and correct API integration. This led me to delve deeper into Postman for API testing, which proved to be an invaluable tool in efficiently debugging and resolving these issues.

### Bonus Features

Due to time constraints, I couldn't implement any bonus features. However, my focus was on ensuring the core functionality was well-written and well-tested.
